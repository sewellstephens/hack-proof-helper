Want an easy way to stop people from accessing gated content? Use this javascript example for a example of how and how not to.

# Don't be careless
Ensure users don't have the inspector panel as an option to work around paying.

# Don't layer unhidden content
To ensure inspector panel isn't an easy workaround, redirect the user in the background. This will ensure it doesn't get used without right plan.

# Example code in repo
This repo contains example code under the name 'example.js'.
