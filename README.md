Want an easy way to stop people from accessing gated content? Use this javascript example for a example of how and how not to.

# Don't be careless
Ensure users don't have the inspector panel as an option to work around paying.

# Don't layer unhidden content
To ensure inspector panel isn't an easy workaround, hide the hidden content then layer it with upgrade prompt. This will ensure it doesn't get used without right plan.

# Redirect to another page may also be an option
I've used this one in some sinarios as well, and it is probably better since the inspector panel isn't an option.
